# DataInfra &middot; RedactionEverything

**Local-first unstructured data redaction for documents, scanned PDFs, images, Word files, and plain text**

RedactionEverything is a local-first redaction workbench for sensitive information in real-world files. It combines semantic NER, OCR, visual object detection, configurable industry schemas, human review, batch processing, and export workflows so sensitive content can be found, reviewed, and anonymized without sending raw documents to a remote API.

## Overview

**RedactionEverything** is a document anonymization system designed for local deployment. It splits unstructured files into text and vision pipelines, detects names, organizations, IDs, accounts, addresses, amounts, dates, seals, faces, signatures, and other sensitive elements, then provides a review interface, batch task management, and exportable redacted outputs.

The goal is not a narrow fixed-rule PII scanner. The project is built around configurable schemas:

- General schemas cover people, organizations, contact details, credentials, accounts, financial values, dates, addresses, and common identifiers.
- Industry schemas cover legal, finance, and healthcare scenarios with domain-specific detection items.
- Text recognition is handled by HaS Text semantic NER by default; regex is kept only as a user-defined fallback capability.
- Vision recognition combines OCR + HaS, HaS Image YOLO, and VLM checklist/rubric detection for visual semantic features such as signatures.
- Raw files, configuration, recognition results, and exported artifacts are intended to remain inside a local or intranet runtime.

---

## Positioning

RedactionEverything is designed as a full redaction workbench rather than a text-only privacy filter. Projects such as [OpenAI Privacy Filter](https://github.com/openai/privacy-filter) are valuable high-throughput baselines for token-level PII detection in text. This project targets a different layer of the problem: messy Chinese and bilingual business documents, scanned PDFs, Word contracts, images, visual privacy regions, human review, batch delivery, and local deployment.

The distinction is scope, not rhetoric:

- **Language and schema depth:** Chinese contracts, legal files, finance documents, healthcare materials, and mixed Chinese-English content often require domain schemas rather than a small fixed label set.
- **Document reality:** Production files are rarely clean text. They include PDF layout, OCR noise, tables, stamps, signatures, screenshots, photos, and scanned pages.
- **Vision coverage:** OCR+HaS handles text inside images, HaS Image YOLO handles visual regions, and VLM rubric detection fills gaps such as handwritten signatures.
- **Operational workflow:** Recognition is only the first step. The system includes review, correction, selection, batch processing, task state, result history, and export packaging.
- **Privacy boundary:** The default architecture keeps raw files and model inference local or inside an intranet instead of depending on hosted external APIs.

## Features

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| Single-file processing | Upload TXT, DOCX, PDF, scanned PDF, PNG, JPG, and similar files, then recognize, review, redact, and export in one workflow. |
| Batch processing | Select a schema, upload a mixed queue, run recognition, review each file, and export packaged results. |

## Quick Start

### Requirements

| Dependency | Recommended version |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 24 LTS |
| Python | 3.11 |
| GPU | NVIDIA GPU; 16 GB VRAM is recommended for the full vision pipeline |
| CUDA | Match the local Paddle / vLLM / llama.cpp build you use |

Model weights, real samples, uploaded files, runtime databases, logs, and exported results are not committed to this repository. Configure local paths in your own environment.

### One-command Local Startup (Windows + WSL)

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the local hybrid profile in a fixed order: vLLM model services and the OCR wrapper in WSL, Windows CUDA llama.cpp VLM, HaS Image, the backend API, and finally the frontend. The script runs model warmup first. It only prints the ready signal after HaS Text, PaddleOCR-VL, PP-StructureV3, HaS Image, and GLM VLM all warm up successfully:

```text
[dev] ready: http://localhost:3000
```

Stop all local services:

```bash
npm run stop
```

If WSL localhost forwarding is unavailable, the startup script automatically uses the WSL IP for vLLM/OCR services so frontend service detection does not incorrectly report them as offline. Model services should stay on GPU/CUDA; if `/health/services` reports CPU fallback risk for any critical model, fix the runtime before processing files.

### Manual Backend Startup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Health checks:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/services
```

### Manual Frontend Startup

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

### Docker

The repository keeps Dockerfiles and compose configuration for containerized frontend, backend, and model-service deployments. Before production deployment, configure `.env`, model mounts, GPU runtime, authentication, reverse proxy, and access-control policies.

## Model Services

Default local ports:

| Service | Port | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| Backend API | 8000 | Uploads, jobs, presets, recognition, redaction, export |
| Frontend | 3000 | Browser workbench |
| HaS Text | 8080 | OpenAI-compatible text NER service |
| HaS Image | 8081 | YOLO11 visual-region detection |
| PaddleOCR-VL | 8082 | OCR, layout, and text boxes |
| VLM | 8090 | OpenAI-compatible visual-semantic supplement |

Common environment variables:

```env
OCR_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8082
HAS_TEXT_RUNTIME=vllm
HAS_TEXT_VLLM_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
HAS_IMAGE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8081
VLM_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
VLM_MODEL_NAME=GLM-4.6V-Flash-Q4
```

When VRAM is tight, adjust context length, maximum generation tokens, concurrency, and image size before allowing any critical model to silently fall back to CPU. CPU fallback typically appears in the UI as long waits, missing results, or offline service probes.

## Limitations and GPU Memory

RedactionEverything intentionally keeps recognition inside a local or intranet inference loop. The system processes raw sensitive files; sending those files to an online API may enable larger vision-language models, but it also weakens the privacy boundary that a redaction infrastructure is meant to provide. The default engineering direction is therefore single-GPU workstation deployment, with quantization, context control, concurrency control, and pipeline scheduling used to compress the full workflow into a local GPU runtime.

The VLM stage in the vision pipeline is not a replacement for HaS Image YOLO11. It is a complementary layer. YOLO11 covers common visual privacy regions such as faces, fingerprints, identity documents, bank cards, seals, QR codes, and screens. It does not currently include a separately trained object-detection class for handwritten signatures. Signatures and signing strokes require more visual-semantic judgment, so the default local profile uses the GLM-4.6V-Flash Q4 quantized model with rubric/checklist prompting to detect signature regions.

This design has a clear resource tradeoff. The complete local pipeline can include PaddleOCR-VL, HaS Text, HaS Image YOLO, and GLM VLM at the same time. Even with warmup, GPU health checks, context compression, and serialized VLM scheduling, devices below 16 GB VRAM may still slow down under VRAM pressure, KV cache allocation, multi-page images, or concurrent requests. For the full vision pipeline, 16 GB or more NVIDIA VRAM is recommended.

If your documents do not need signature recognition, disable the VLM/signature item in the preset configuration or in the single-file recognition panel. Keeping only OCR+HaS and HaS Image usually gives more stable latency and more VRAM headroom.

Larger local VLMs can improve visual-semantic understanding, but they also raise the deployment bar. This project prioritizes practical local deployment on personal workstations, single-GPU laptops, and intranet machines rather than depending on the largest possible model or a hosted external API.

## Presets

The system includes four preset families:

| Preset | Purpose |
|---|---|
| General | People, organizations, IDs, accounts, contact details, addresses, amounts, dates, and common sensitive entities |
| Legal | Parties, agents, courts, case numbers, contract identifiers, case facts, and legal-document fields |
| Finance | Accounts, cards, transactions, amounts, institutions, customers, and financial business data |
| Healthcare | Patients, medical institutions, examinations, diagnoses, medications, medical records, and visit information |

Text and image pipeline presets are independent. When creating a new preset, each module supports select-all and clear-all actions so schemas can be quickly trimmed for a scenario.

## Security and Deployment

- The repository should contain application code and default configuration only. Do not commit local `.env` files, model weights, real samples, uploaded files, runtime databases, logs, or exported results.
- The default deployment model is local or intranet use. Before exposing the system to the public internet, configure authentication, access control, reverse proxy, TLS, logging, and key-rotation policies.
- Default recognition is driven by model capability and configured schemas. Regex exists only as a user-defined fallback mechanism.
- Keep models, samples, task data, and export directories in private runtime storage protected by access control and backup policies.
